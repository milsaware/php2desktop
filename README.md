## About

php2desktop gives developers the ability to create content rich native Windows GUI applications using web technologies they're familiar with. Zero C language knowledge is necessary, simply copy your web files into the www directory and run by opening the .exe file. In a way, php2desktop is a PHP to exe compiler without the headache of running commands.

php2desktop is an out-of-the-box solution that comes pre-built with PHP 8 and a Chromium 114 embedded browser; combine with the power of JavaScript, SQLite, HTML5 & CSS3 and you'll be making native desktop applications as easy as building a web application.

Connect to APIs for interactive applications. Use your favourite framework such as Bootstrap or Laravel and change nothing about your workflow ... Your imagination's your only limit.

## Basic

php2desktop comes in either Basic or Pro flavours. php2desktop Basic is a **free** download intended for Windows 32Bit systems. Simply [Click here to download](https://github.com/ozboware/php2desktop/releases/tag/v1.0.0) and select **php2desktop-x86.zip**. Once downloaded, unzip the package, locate the **www** directory, insert your web files and open the application by double-clicking the **php2desktop.exe** file. And that's it! No need to change your coding flow, no need to learn new frameworks, languages or APIs; just copy, paste and you're done.

The Basic version comes with some drawbacks, however. It is only designed for 32Bit systems and you will need to use third party software such as [Resource Hacker](http://angusj.com/resourcehacker/) to change your icon and meta data.

## Pro

If you're looking for more control over your application, then go Pro! Unlike countless other applications out there that seem more concerned about their own **"job security"**, where the end user has to rely on the original developer for crucial updates, only to be left disappointed because the app's been abandoned or not touched for years; I thought I'd try a different route. Going pro gives you full access to the source code along with detailed instructions (which include illustrations for easier understanding as well as being written in 15 different languages) on how you can compile your own version with your own icons and various settings including:

- minimise to tray
- add minimised notification
- adding context menus
- edit window properties
- change directory names of PHP & www
- starting the app maximised

and even more crucially

- how to update your Chromium and PHP versions with ease

By going Pro, I will be giving you all the tools and easy to understand information you need to ensure you never have to rely on me or anyone else ever again to keep your app updated and running the way you want it to run. All you need is Visual Studio 2022 and it's related build tools. What's more, I can guarantee that even a beginner will be confident in compiling the application within just a few hours.

If, like me, you've been left frustrated at looking for PHP to exe compilers by finding nothing but dead applications, then you would agree it is worth a **one off** fee of just **Â£19.99** to never face that disappointment again in the future.

To go Pro, simply go to the [php2desktop website](https://php2desktop/purchase), enter an email address and password, you will then be taken to the Stripe payment page to complete the purchase. After completing the checkout, you will be redirected to your account where you can download php2desktop Pro.
