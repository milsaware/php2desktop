php2desktop comes in two different versions. 1.0.0 utilises CefSharp

-----

## php2desktop 1.0.0

php2desktop 1.0.0 utilises CefSharp for the Browser-UI. It's limited with its settings and, like all available alternatives, doesn't allow the playback of MP4 files. It's good for most projects, but if you're looking at throwing in some videos, it's practically useless.

-----

## php2desktop 2.0.0

php2desktop 2.0.0 utilises WebView2 for the Browser-UI. It includes a settings file to easily manipulate window, PHP and browser settings after the build and, unlike any similar alternatives, does allow the playback of MP4 files. It's the most powerful version of its kind of software available open source.

## Comments

Both versions have been made in a way that allows you to use the latest version of Chromium in the easiest possible way. There's no need to compile a Chromium version. It's not dependant on a specific Chromium version. It's not dependant on a specific VS version and more importantly it's not going to take you days or even hours to build with the latest updates. All you need is minutes. Even a first-timer should have their first build with the latest updates in under half an hour, it really is that simple.
